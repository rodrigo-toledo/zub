# Project Brief: Zub (Subliminal Zig Port)

Zub is a Zig-based port of the popular Python library, Subliminal. The primary goal is to create a high-performance, single-binary, cross-platform command-line tool for automatically finding and downloading subtitles for video files.

The project aims to replicate the core functionality of Subliminal, including video file scanning, metadata parsing, multiple subtitle provider integration, and a sophisticated scoring system to find the best subtitle match.
